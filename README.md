Beautiful Instant Statuspages for Statuscake

![Preview](https://github.com/sjorssnoeren/cheesecake/raw/master/.github/preview.png)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
For the deployment of this status page you'll need a server space compatible Node.js and ES6.  
(All versions of Node.js later than 6.0, of 5.x versions with the ES6 standard enabled)

You can bypass this process by directly deploying your Cheesecake to Heroku.  
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Installation is quite easy, after you've deployed the project, set these environment variables:

```

// Obtained using the control panel of StatusCake
STATUSCAKE_ACCESS_TOKEN=3123423432	  

// As expected, title of your account or site
SITE_TITLE=Your Site Title
```
You can either use a dotenv file or set those variables natively. If you have not correctly configured the variables, no worries. You will receive a 503 saying that you've misconfigured your installation.


## üõ† Usage
It is also possible to run Cheesecake locally. To start the app just run `npm install` once to download all dependencies and `npm start` to launch Cheesecake.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Theming
It is fairly simple to customize Cheesecake to your needs. Clone or download the project and edit the `theme.css` file right in `/public/css/`. No need to compile, since we're not using any preproccessor at this point.  

And yes, you may remove the "Powered by Cheesecake" notice at the bottom of the page if you really want to üòÑ.
